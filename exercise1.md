# Python CI Pipeline for Team Development

## Core CI Components

For our Python application developed by a team of six, we would implement these essential CI components:

**Code Quality Tools**:
- `flake8` for basic PEP 8 compliance checking
- `pylint` for more comprehensive static analysis
- `mypy` (optional) if using type hints
- `bandit` for security vulnerability scanning

**Testing Framework**:
- Primary: `pytest` with standard plugins
  - `pytest-cov` for coverage reporting (aim for 80%+ coverage)
  - `pytest-xdist` for parallel test execution
- Alternative: `unittest` for teams more familiar with it

**Build & Packaging**:
- `poetry` for modern dependency management
- `tox` for testing across Python 3.8-3.11
- `build` and `twine` for package creation

## CI Platform Options

**Cloud-Based Solutions**:
1. GitHub Actions:
   - Native integration with GitHub repos
   - Growing Python community support
   - Generous free tier for public repos

2. GitLab CI/CD:
   - Excellent container support
   - Built-in package registry
   - Single solution for code and CI

3. CircleCI:
   - Powerful caching for faster builds
   - Convenient Python orb for common tasks

**Self-Hosted Alternatives**:
- Jenkins:
  - Most customizable option
  - Large plugin ecosystem
  - Requires significant maintenance

- Drone CI:
  - Lightweight container-native runner
  - Simpler configuration than Jenkins
  - Good for teams using Docker

## Hosting Decision Analysis

**Cloud Benefits**:
- Immediate availability (no setup delays)
- Automatic security patching
- Pay-as-you-go pricing model
- Built-in integrations with other services

**Self-Hosted Advantages**:
- Complete control over build environment
- No internet access required
- Can use specialized hardware
- Potentially better long-term costs

**Decision Checklist**:
- [ ] Does our company have data residency requirements?
- [ ] Do we have dedicated DevOps resources?
- [ ] What's our budget for CI services?
- [ ] Are we using other cloud services already?

For most small Python teams like ours, starting with GitHub Actions provides the best combination of ease-of-use and functionality. As the project grows, we can reevaluate based on our specific needs around security, performance, and cost.
